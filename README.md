It is a work in progress ðŸš§.

This repository is a direct continuation to my MoviesPoint project.
Most of the code is template code that I wanted to fiddle with to see how
the leanback library works.

There are some bugs, lots of refactoring and some features to add
but the main goal was to experiment with the leanback library and
building a scaleable and modularized app.

Eventually this repository will be merged with MoviesPoint,
keeping the best in both and adding more features to accomodate different form
factors.

Feel free to download the apk in the main folder to test the app for yourself.
If you wish to debug it, further instructions on configuration with firebase and api keys
will be attached soon.

Go Android!
